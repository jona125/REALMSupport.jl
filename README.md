# REALMSupport

This is a collection of supporting codes of REALM, mainly writen in Julia

explanation for each julia code:

grid_fun.jl: calculation gird image stript width and spacing.

gauss_fit.jl: 1 dimensional gaussing fitting.


cut_region.jl: crap from filtered REALM image for ROI.

filter.jl: filtered REALM image base on background recording.

flat_recon.jl: stich band of image from light sheet plane based on z position.


psf_fun.jl: function for PSF calculation.

realm_align.jl: image alignment correction between different stack.

stack.jl: stack different YZ, XZ cross section of image.

time.jl: collect time series of certain z plane.

swipe_analysis.jl: calculate swipe speed and range through grid sample.

COM.jl: calculate center of mass.
